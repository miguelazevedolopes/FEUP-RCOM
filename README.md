# Computer Networks Projects

## [Project 1 - Data Transmission Protocol (using RS-232 port)](./PROJECT1)

This project consisted of developing a simple data transmission protocol between computers using an asynchronous serial port (RS-232). The protocol was implemented in a LINUX environment using the C programming language.

## [Project 2 - FTP Protocol Implementation](./PROJECT2)

This project is divided into two parts. The first part involves the development of a simple FTP application that retrieves a specified file using the FTP (File Transfer Protocol). In the second part, a small network is configured based on four different experiments, including IP address configuration, VLAN configuration, Routing Configuration online and in the lab.

The source code for both parts of the project was developed using the C programming language, and the project was specifically designed to target Linux devices.

This repository, and every other repository (I own) named in the format FEUP-COURSENAME on GitHub correspond to the projects I developed during my time as a student at Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto.
